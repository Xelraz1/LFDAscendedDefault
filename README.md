# LFD Ascended Default (3.3.5)

A small World of Warcraft **3.3.5a** addon for Stormforge WoW's custom **Ascended Dungeon** queue option.

This addon automatically switches the Dungeon Finder (LFD) dropdown to **Random Ascended Dungeon** when you press **I**, so you don’t accidentally queue **Random Heroic**.

---

## Features
- Automatically selects **Random Ascended Dungeon** on LFD open
- Prevents the UI/server from snapping back to **Heroic** (only during the first couple seconds after opening)
- Lets you manually select Heroic later without being forced back
